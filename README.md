## Features Indepth ###

### Main App Interface ###

- It allows the user to add the skills either manually or by text file.
- We'll use an oldschool python command line interface. 
- Using letters you can either enter Add mode (A) or Draw Mode (D).
- Pressing S allows one to save the current state of the dictionaries as JSON files
- Pressing L re-initializes the saved dictionaries, the program will check if the saved_data file is empty and if it is not it will prompt you to load the saved data before proceding.


### Graph Drawer 

- This just draws the graphs from the dictionaries.
